          No more champagne
          And the fireworks are through
          Here we are, me and you
          Feeling lost and feeling blue
          It's the end of the party
          And the morning seems so grey
          So unlike yesterday
          Now's the time for us to say

          Happy New Year, Happy New Year
          May we all have a vision now and then
          Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
          Happy New Year, Happy New Year
          May we all have our hopes, our will to try
          If we don't, we might as well lay down and die
          You and I
